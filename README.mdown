rvtmod
======

rvtmod is a set of tools made to create and modify Re-Volt binary files, originally created by Alexander Kr√∂ller. Check out [ali's revolt stuff](http://www.perror.de/rv/), the official page where rvtmod resides. 

This repository is meant to hold a maintained version (starting at rvtmod7) that expands the features of the original toolset. 

Building rvtmod
---------------

CMake scripts are supplied. You can refer to CMake's documentation to figure out how to create your project files. Here's a simple usage for UNIX folks: 

`mkdir -p <my-build-path> && cd <my-build-path> && cmake <path-to-rvtmod> && make`
